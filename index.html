        <h3>Latest Project</h3>
        <p>I have been working on a website for the youth at my church. This website gives them access to the church blog, sermon videos, as well as daily encouragements and the gallery. The website will also have a chatbox where the youth can speak to each other, the youth pastor and the youth leaders. They can enter these chatrooms anonymously so that they are more comfortabe speaking and sharing sensitive info.   </p>
